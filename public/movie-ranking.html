<h1>It's Movie Time, Baby!</h1>
<br />
<h2>My top 3 all-time movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>In love with sci-fi, 
and the movie presents a very 
interesting idea. A must watch!
</p>
<h3>2. The Lion King (1994)</h3>
<p>This was my first movie love
 and it's still my favorite animated
 movie. I know all the lines by heart! :p
</p>
<h3>3. Joker (2019)</h3>
<p>What can I say? Was deeply impressed
with the performance. Joaquin Phoenix is
a great actor. Not saying better than 
ol' Nicholson, but still impressive.
